This repository contains the functions used to handle the data produced in the MODHEP project (http://www.modhep.eu/) and my internship at the De Laat group. These functions can be used as a stand-alone or the plotFigures script can be used to produce the figures present in thesis. 

To see a tutorial of peakHiC, visit the peakHiC repository at delaatlab.

In this internship the effects of MYC overexpression were analyzed using Hi-C, ChIP-seq and transcriptome data from mice liver cells.
